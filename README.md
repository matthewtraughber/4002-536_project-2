## Project 2: SVG Web Presence
### RIT - 4002-536 Web Client Side Programming, Fall 2012

I've open-sourced my project 2 submission for future students to reference as an example. This application parses Flickr JSON and imitates tossing polaroids on the web browser. Users can click & drag the images.

#### DEMO
Nope. This is quite old, and needs updating to pull current Flickr data.
