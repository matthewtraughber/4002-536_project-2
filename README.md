## Project 2: SVG Web Presence
### RIT - 4002-536 Web Client Side Programming, Fall 2012

I've open-sourced my project 2 submission for future students to reference as an example. This application parses Flickr JSON and imitates tossing polaroids on the web browser. Users can click & drag the images.

#### Project requirements
* Some level of interactivity built into a menu system (you are only building one page - the links don't have to go to another SVG page - but should connect to something (how about linking to other project you made and leave a link for the jquery project?))
* Use of all primitive types is not necessary, but I am making you have a curve built with \<path>
  * Possible use of Adobe Illustrator or Kiyut (http://www.kiyut.com/products/sketsa/index.html) to draw the \<path> is encouraged
  * The only part that you can use these tools for is the \<path> - everything else you must 'draw' by hand
* Animation/interactivity built using (both):
  * JavaScript
  * SMIL
* Dynamic creation of some page element (Simply regurgitating what I build in class will not suffice!)
* Use of CSS to define your styles
* Include comments in the code to clearly explain functionality
* Your SVG pages will be viewed using either the Opera browser (http://www.opera.com/) or the safari browser since they have the most complete viewing capabilities
